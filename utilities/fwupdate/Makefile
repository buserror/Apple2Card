# This bizare contraption allows having C like macros in the assembly
# that is helpful when now using multiple platforms with different page size
# * We first pass the .asm file to cc65 -E, that creates (annoyingly) a .i in
#    the same directory as the .asm file.
# * We mv that file to the bin directory
# * Use 'sed' in-place to remove stray #line directives added by cc65
# * We pass *that* file in to the assembler
# Note, the bin-%/dan2stk500.asm file is kept, so you can 'diff'it.
